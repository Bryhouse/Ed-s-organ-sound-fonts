# Ed-s-organ-sound-fonts
This was my dad's hobby/passion after retiring from the Naval Research Laboratory.  When I was growing up, my mother was a church organist.  Providing her with a church quality organ at home has always been an interrest of his.  The electronic organs of my youth didn't sound that great (not that I could judge them), and were not very reliable. Many decades later, the technology has come a long way, but still my dad was searching to perfect the church organ sound.  He produced his own sound fonts by analyzing recorded notes and then mathmatically resynthesizing them.  He constructed a full dual manual and peddleboard midi organ to play these sound fonts through a computer hosting 3 soundblaster sound cards, and running a program called JOrgan.  He was never very skilled at playing the organ, which is why he also used his sound fonts to play sheet music that he painstakenly transcribed into the computer.  This is what produced the many MP3 audio CDs.    
In addition to these CDs, this archive also contains all of his source code and documentation.  Also, the JOrgan files and sound font files are included.
