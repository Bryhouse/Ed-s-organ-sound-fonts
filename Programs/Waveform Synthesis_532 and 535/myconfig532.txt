nsamp		number of samples in the envelope and time files
num_partials	number of partial freqs in the synthesis
freq0  		freq at which original sample was taken
freq1		ref freq for timbre scaling
scale_param	Slope of timbre conversion formula (2.42 for Principal pipe)
spec_scale	parameter to set roll off of transient partial amplitude w/freq
		(usually in range of 0.5 to 0.7)
maxtime   	(usually <1.0)
start_note 	(1 for C1; 7 for C2)
stop_note  	(31 for C6; 37-C7; 43-C8; 49-C9)
time_f-offset_end (0.0 to avoid this effect,
		otherwise 0.4 to 0.5)
bypass  	(chiff processing bypass 1=yes, 0=no)
chiff_index  	(partial number that carries chiff)
chiff_end  	(envelope sample number to stop Modify-chiff ftn, count from 0)
chiff_ref_freq  (freq reference usedin Modify_chiff ftn)
				use high freq to enhance chiff at low end
				use low freq if less chiff is needed at low end
chiff_mult  freq-independent multiplier for the chiff
